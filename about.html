<center> <p style="color: white; font-size: 25px;"> <img src="./Images/defprofile.png" alt="Avatar" style="float:left;"> ï»¿As a Computer Science Major at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (Tech), I have always been passionate about technology and its potential to revolutionize our daily lives. From working with Microsoft Office applications like Excel, Powerpoint, and Word to experimenting with Photoshop all from a young age, my curiosity has led me down the path of computer science.

During my first year at university, I built my own personal computer from scratch, which I still use today with occasional upgrades and maintenance. Throught my time at univeritsty I have learned and spanded on software development concepts such as programming languages like Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Servlets/MySQL.

I have also gained valuable knowledge in data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and software development principles through my individual coding experiences and group projects at university. One of my favorite projects was a pseudo donut shop application built with Java, which showcased my skills in object-oriented programming. Another project involved creating an HTML-based phesudo movie store that used MySQL and JavaScript to demonstrate my proficiency in database management and web development.

After graduating from New Mexico Tech in May 2025, I am excited about the endless possibilities that technology has to offer. Whether it's pursuing a career in software development, systems administration, or data analysis, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society. </p>
